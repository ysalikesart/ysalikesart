<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Brush Script MT;"><a>About the artist/student: Ysabel Dawana </a></h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a> Hi, I am Ysabella "Ysabel" Dawana and I am a traditional artist who specializes in two different practices: black&white drawing and oil painting (and I am currently relearning how to paint with watercolor and goauche). I have been clutched into the art world since 2013 when I found my true passion for drawing. It stuck with me ever since. I graduated with an associates in Studio Arts in December of 2023 with a degree in Studio Arts in Mission College in Santa Clara and I am currently attending San Jose State University hoping to earn a bachelor of arts degree in Art with emphasis of studio practice in pictorial. Soon after I graduate, I might go for a masters degree in Pictorial, but I have not decided when it is the right time. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <a> Digital media art as a whole is not my strong suit but it is mandatory that I have to take a beginning digital media art class in order to satisfy the requirements of to obtain my bachelors degree in this particular art field. However, I have been willing to learn the basics of some aspects of digital media art production and I have at least developed some of these techniques from this practice or course. Some of my inspirations of my DMA works are snebtor, my cousin, and Google images. </a></p>
